# UniGraphicsEngine

Graphics engine made using c++ and win32 to draw a 3d model in many stages, includes:
- base wireframe
- backface cull
- depth sorting
- flatshading
- gouraud shading
- diffuse ligthing
- specular lighting
- dodgy texturing, still needs work

Lighting types:
- ambient
- directional
- point
- spot

Lighting calculations follow the blinn-phong reflection model
